# eCommerceMultiArchitecture
I will apply multi architecture to this simple ecommerce like Clean Architecture - Vertical Slice - Repository with Unit of Work

I will try building a modern ASP.NET Core API with all the essential features:

# Core Architecture
1- Clean Architecture (Layers: Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
2- Vertical Slice Architecture (for complex domains)
3- CQRS Pattern (Separate Commands and Queries)
4- MediatR Library for implementing CQRS

# Security Essentials
1- CORS Policy (Strictly configured)
2- CSRF Protection (For cookie/auth scenarios)
3- Rate Limiting (See below)
4- Input Validation (FluentValidation)
5- Output Sanitization
6- HTTPS Redirection

# Logging & Monitoring
1- Health Checks UI
2- Audit Logging for sensitive operations
3- Structured Logging (Serilog)

# Rate Limiting


# Performance Optimization
1-Response Caching
2- Compression
3- EF Core Performance
4- Dapper for performance-critical queries
5- Redis Caching

# API Best Practices
1- RESTful Design
    - Proper resource naming
    - Correct HTTP verbs
    - HATEOAS where appropriate

 # Versioning   
 1- Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
 2- Validation
 3- DTOs (Avoid exposing domain models directly)

# Testing
1- Unit Tests (xUnit/NUnit)

# Modern Libraries
1- Mapster (Faster alternative to AutoMapper)
2- FluentValidation
3- MediatR (CQRS implementation)
4- Dapper (Micro-ORM for performance)
